Enhancement: Re-design ugly yellow notification bar 

Yellow notification center got redesigned:
- Not blocking the top centered logo anymore
- gets more attention using icons and red color
- looks more modern
- show close button as default option. Add option `hideCloseButton (bool)` to hide it if needed
